# Visualizing Covid-19 case counts by county in the US

The New York Times is providing data files with the cumulative counts of Covid-19 cases in the United States, at the state and county level. [Covid-19 Map](https://covid-19-map.leshill.org) is a visualization of that data over time.

## Colophon

**Covid-19 Map** is an example of a JAM-stack app&mdash; **J**avaScript **A**PI and **M**arkup.

The app is built with React, Redux, and Redux Sagas. The source code is TypeScript.

The data is pulled from the GitHub API.

The HTML is styled with Bootstrap.

There are no tests :scream_cat: !?!
