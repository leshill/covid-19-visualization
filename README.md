# Visualizing Covid-19 case counts by county in the US

The New York Times is providing data files with the cumulative counts of Covid-19 cases in the United States, at the state and county level. [Covid-19 Map](https://covid-19-map.leshill.org) is a visualization of that data over time.

"On day one, no one you know is sick. It feels like a normal day. It may stay like this for a long time until, one day, a few people you know are sick. And suddenly a few days later it will seem like everyone is sick, and it will feel like it happened instantly. Everything looks fine until it isn't fine. This is the paradox of pandemics."

## Colophon

**Covid-19 Map** is an example of a JAM-stack app&mdash; **J**avaScript **A**PI and **M**arkup.

The app is built with React, Redux, and Redux Sagas. The source code is TypeScript.

The data is pulled from the GitHub API.

The HTML is styled with Bootstrap.

There are no tests :scream_cat: !?!
